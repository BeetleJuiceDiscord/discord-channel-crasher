# discord-channel-crasher
This program works by generating a huge amount of random ascii and sending it into a channel in attempt to crash it.

## installation
In your terminal, type "py -m pip install json", "py -m pip install discord", "py -m pip install random", and "py -m pip install string".

in config.json, replace "INPUT TOKEN HERE" with your Discord token.

run bot.py and you are finished :)

### extra
I'm not responsible for anything you do with this program :) it is against Discords TOS so I dont recommend using it.
